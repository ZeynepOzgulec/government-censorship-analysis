# government-censorship-analysis
A data-driven exploration of government ideology and online censorship in Western democracies(2011â€“2020).

## ðŸ“„ Project Description

This repository contains my original data analysis and modeling work for a collaborative academic project examining how government ideology affects content removal requests in democratic countries.

The literature review and introductory sections of the final paper were authored by my collaborator and are **not included here**, out of respect for their intellectual contribution.

All R code, statistical models, and visualizations in this repository were developed by me using data from Google Transparency Reports, OECD datasets, and the Global Terrorism Index.
